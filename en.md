## Verse 1: Taco

One hundred ton train crawling on rails

Rails roar like mother who moans after sons

Because the history clock indicates that the time of death has come

Can someone make track stop groan?

I see in the compartment through the window

Man who apparently had spent four winters here

Cold eyes, thick beard, beneath has a bear like teeth

By the way, I'm Filip Szcze≈õniak if you didn't know yet

And in the future I will try to fly

No clue why again I'm punished for

He looks at me constantly like he tried to fraternize

Washed tweed and shirt like old tablecloth

Check me out instantaneously, I'm sure He'll try to talk to me

About state of mind and civil status, what father is doin'

And about me, then suddenly a terrible noise sneak in

Opened door - "Coke, beer, crisps, coffee, tea!"

He has a cruel mouth and a supercilious tone

Buy from him? I'd rather buy frost in Siberia

Passenger gets rapidly, crosses Rubicon

Quietly improve his tie and then says, "Get the fuck out!"

I see the cool marble of his eye

Dark thoughts in his skull already want to wake up

His desires are hidden, not for show

I can see that he wants to have a big house, full of other people's wives

## Hook

I want to have a big house, full of other people's wives, do you hear me?

Only you I can tell straight out, that I like to wade in numbers

Some people like to gambol, and some want peace

The whole house in marble, the whole house in marble

Dark thoughts sleep again on the top

## Verse 4

You deserve the last closing verse

I have passenger in my head, what a gloomy character

From the mirror looks at me stranger

Simultaneously my good and bad half

Night aura appeals to him

Red light, could be a voicemail?

Is this a terrible, disturbing news?

Who found me here, who is dreaming of the night conversation?


I want to have a big house, full of other people's wives, do you hear me ...
