## Verse 1: Taco

One hundred tons train creeps on the rails

Rails roar like mother who moans after sons

Because the history clock indicates that the time to die has come

Can anyone make rails stop groan?

In the compartment through the window I see

Man who apparently had spent four winters here

Cold eyes, thick beard, beneath it has a bear like teeth

By the way, I'm Filip Szcześniak if you don't know

And in the future I will try to fly

No clue what for I'm punished again

He looks at me constantly, like he try to fraternize

Washed tweed and shirt like old tablecloth

Checks me out instantaneously, I'm sure he'll try to talk to me

About state of mind and civil status, what father is doing

And about me, then suddenly a terrible noise sneaks in

Opened door - "Coke, beer, crisps, coffee, tea!"

He has a cruel mouth and a supercilious tone

Buy from him? I'd rather buy frost in Siberia

Passenger gets up rapidly, crosses Rubicon

Quietly improves his tie and then says, "Get out!"

I see the cold marble of his eye

Dark thoughts in his skull want to wake up

His desires are hidden, not for show

I can see that he wants to have a big house, full of other people's wives

## Hook

I want to have a big house, full of other people's wives, do you hear me?

Only you I can tell straight out, that I like to wade in numbers

Some people like to gambol, and some want peace

The whole house in marble, the whole house in marble

Dark thoughts sleep again on the top

## Zwrotka 2

Lamb's blood colored veins

My age I think, but as if he sees more

As if he climbs the steep peaks of life more valiantly

Doesn't use technology, everything writing by hand

Doesn't put on gym suit to go on treadmills

Because whole life hew was running away or running after someone

Suddenly, I see eye looking at me from under the powerful eyebrow

You better start to smile or stop staring

I enter the code 4822

Six missed calls from 'Only child'

'Only child' is planning Taco's concerts

Voicemail, I hear, "Felipe there will be troubles"

And I ran away, because I'm tired of rap-game

Just a few more moments and someone will have put me in a straitjacket

I'm too old to fight for the favor of the world

I want to burn down all my work, like Kafka before his death

Tires and surprise me all

I always felt that I can disappear at any moment

Now I feel that I won't return to the singles quickly

Cancel the tour John, Fifi vanished

I look at the neighbor, I think he already fell asleep

Where I'm going, I sense that you wonder

I love the Warsaw, but it's getting a bit crowded

Again, these voices when my train arrives in 'Tricity'

## Hook

I want to have a big house, full of other people's wives, do you hear me?

Only you I can tell straight out, that I like to wade in numbers

Some people like to gambol, and some want peace

The whole house in marble, the whole house in marble

Dark thoughts sleep again on the top

## Zwrotka 3

I open the window and absorb the call of the sea

A brisk wind, the great world, water wilderness

It's just a little me, against the immensity of the skies

And young boys sniffing in white into their nostrils

Getting pink like a hog from rotisserie

Hoping that the chosen one will be godless

Although life is a bad dream, sometimes even nightmare

I don't want to wake up - how can you say that?

I won't search for experience

I want to live in a hotel, sometimes maybe go to the beach

Write an album, drink tea and feel like an old man

Because I want to relax, before I end up like this fellow

Who disappeared, such a pity I had a plan

Well, I wanted to ask him how do I know him

These last few days I slept a little in Warsaw, it's a fact

Are this hallucinations, was I alone in the compartment?

Impossible... It's just a good ruse

Do I have hallucinations because I changed up in an alcoholic?

Hard business, I'll talk about this later

Because I got out and walk through to the Polish fjord

Sky dark and sticky like stout

With my eyes effort, I see quite a huge hotel

The huge hall, in it I find a modest seat

There is a huge mustache, followed by a night porter

## Dialog

- Mr. Szcześniak, good evening, we waited for you. We checked you in room 515

- I do not have any reservation, so...

- Please, I invite you to the elevator. We realize that a lot of work in front of you, of course, but I encourage you to participate in the life of our hotel. In a few days, it takes place in the evening dance, presence is mandatory

- I do not know, I'll see... Do you have maybe charger for this phone...

- No. We encourage guests to not use technology

- Great

- Voilà. Lord's peace, and that's the key, and welcome video. Good night, and good luck.

## Verse 4

You deserve the last closing verse

I have passenger in my head, what a gloomy character

From the mirror looks at me stranger

Simultaneously my good and bad half

Night aura appeals to him

Red light, could it be a voicemail?

Are these a terrible, disturbing news?

Who found me here, who is dreaming of the night conversation?


'I want to have a big house, full of other people's wives, do you hear me ...'
