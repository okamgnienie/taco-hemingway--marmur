## Verse 1: Taco

One hundred tons train creeps on the rails

Rails roar like mother who moans after sons

Because the history clock indicates that the time to die has come

Can anyone make rails stop groan?

In the compartment through the window I see

Man who apparently had spent four winters here

Cold eyes, thick beard, beneath it has a bear like teeth

By the way, I'm Filip Szcze≈õniak if you don't know

And in the future I will try to fly

No clue what for I'm punished again

He looks at me constantly, like he try to fraternize

Washed tweed and shirt like old tablecloth

Checks me out instantaneously, I'm sure he'll try to talk to me

About state of mind and civil status, what father is doing

And about me, then suddenly a terrible noise sneaks in

Opened door - "Coke, beer, crisps, coffee, tea!"

He has a cruel mouth and a supercilious tone

Buy from him? I'd rather buy frost in Siberia

Passenger gets up rapidly, crosses Rubicon

Quietly improves his tie and then says, "Get out!"

I see the cold marble of his eye

Dark thoughts in his skull want to wake up

His desires are hidden, not for show

I can see that he wants to have a big house, full of other people's wives

## Hook

I want to have a big house, full of other people's wives, do you hear me?

Only you I can tell straight out, that I like to wade in numbers

Some people like to gambol, and some want peace

The whole house in marble, the whole house in marble

Dark thoughts sleep again on the top

## Verse 4

You deserve the last closing verse

I have passenger in my head, what a gloomy character

From the mirror looks at me stranger

Simultaneously my good and bad half

Night aura appeals to him

Red light, could it be a voicemail?

Are these a terrible, disturbing news?

Who found me here, who is dreaming of the night conversation?


I want to have a big house, full of other people's wives, do you hear me ...
